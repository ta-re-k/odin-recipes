    <h3><u>Description :</u></h3>
    <p><strong>Risotto</strong>is a creamy <b>Italian</b> dish made with short-grain rice cooked in broth until perfectly tender. It's versatile, with variations featuring mushrooms, seafood, or even saffron for a luxurious touch. Risotto requires constant stirring to release the rice's starch, creating its signature velvety texture.</p>
    <p>The process starts by sautéing onions in butter or olive oil, adding rice, and lightly toasting it. Gradually, warm broth is added while stirring, allowing the rice to absorb the liquid. Once cooked, it's finished with parmesan cheese and a touch of butter for extra creaminess. Risotto is a modern comfort food that's rich, satisfying, and endlessly customizable.</p>
