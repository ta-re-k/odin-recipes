    <h3><u>Description :</u></h3>
    <p><strong><em> Algerian Chakchouka </em></strong> is a beloved Algerian dish that combines torn pieces of thin flatbread (rougag) with a flavorful stew of meat, chickpeas, and vegetables. The bread, often handmade and cooked on a griddle, is torn into bite-sized pieces to form the base of the dish. The stew is made by simmering lamb or chicken with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spices like paprika and cinnamon, creating a hearty and aromatic sauce.</p>
    <p>Once prepared, the stew is poured over the torn bread, allowing it to absorb the rich flavors. This dish is a staple at family gatherings and festive occasions, known for its comforting texture and robust taste. Garnished with fresh herbs, Chakhchoukha is best enjoyed hot, often shared among <em> loved ones as a symbol of warmth and hospitality.</em></p>
